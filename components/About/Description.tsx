        I am a software developer looking to learn and grow with like minded
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a Bachelor of Arts majoring in History and Japanese, and
        graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy focusing on Full Stack Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in software development started in University during my
        Japanese studies. I frequently had to use language apps for learning and
        for use in live translating which got me curious in the underlying tech
        that was being used. As I was studying I saw myself learning to code in
        my spare time and found that the logic and creativity really aligned
        with how I thought and it became a fun outlet during my university
        studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduation I kept coming back to programming and wanted a more
        focused course of study. I opted to attend Enspiral Dev Academy where I
        was able to further my programming knowledge and enhance my
        collaborative skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have now moved to the US where I am interested in working with people
        and companies that are at the forefront of innovation in technology. I
        think my New Zealand upbringing and technical skills will be a huge
        asset to you.
